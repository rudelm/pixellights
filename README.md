Updated to use code from:
* https://learn.adafruit.com/light-painting-with-raspberry-pi/software for fileimport
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_WS2801/blob/master/examples/rainbow.py library examples

Don't forget to install the library with 'sudo pip install adafruit-ws2801'.

For writing serial data on the pi you'll need to diable the serial console first. See http://spellfoundry.com/2016/05/29/configuring-gpio-serial-port-raspbian-jessie-including-pi-3/ for more details.
