Updated to use code from:
* https://learn.adafruit.com/light-painting-with-raspberry-pi/software for fileimport
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_WS2801/blob/master/examples/rainbow.py library examples

Don't forget to install the library with 'sudo pip install adafruit-ws2801'.

For writing serial data on the pi you'll need to use 'sudo apt-get install python-serial' first.
